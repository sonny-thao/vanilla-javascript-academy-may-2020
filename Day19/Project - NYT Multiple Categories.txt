NYT Multiple Categories


Description
-----------

Modify your NYT Top Stories project to get articles from several categories.

With the New York Times API, the category is the part right before .json in the API endpoint.

You can view a list of categories here (https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/routes/%7Bsection%7D.json/get).

Get articles from three to five categories, then render the API data into markup and inject it into the #app element.

Instead of rendering all of the articles, use the first five from each category. Add a heading before each section so that you know what category the articles are from.
