Weather App


Description
-----------

Build an app that gets a user’s location and displays their current weather information.

The template includes a single HTML element with an ID of #app where we’ll render our weather information.

<div id="app">Checking the weather near you...</div>

For this project, you’ll use the free ipapi service (https://ipapi.co/) to get a user’s location (you specifically want this endpoint: https://ipapi.co/json).

You’ll use the returned location data to get the weather data itself from WeatherBit (https://www.weatherbit.io/api). You will need to create a free account for this one.

The WeatherBit API can automatically detect a person’s location, but for learning purposes, use ipapi instead.

WeatherBit also has an API for weather icons (https://www.weatherbit.io/api/codes). Documentation for this one is a bit… lacking. This can be common with APIs, so figuring out how to make this work is an important learning experience, too.

It’s entirely up to you how to display the data in the UI.

The Math

The API returns temperatures in Celcius.

If you want to display them in Farenheit, let me save you from having to Google the math for converting temperatures. Here’s what you need to know.

To convert Farenheit to Celcius, subtract 32 from the temperature, then multiply it by 5 divided by 9.

var cel = (temp - 32) * 5 / 9;

To convert from Celcius to Farenheit, multiply the temperature by 9 divided by 5, then add 32.

var far = (temp * 9 / 5) + 32;
