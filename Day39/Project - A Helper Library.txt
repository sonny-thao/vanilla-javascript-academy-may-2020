It also includes some classes to change the appearance of the buttons.

Create a helper library with public methods you can use toâ€¦

    - Convert a NodeList to an array.
    - Get the first matching element in the DOM.
    - Get all matching elements in the DOM as an array.
    - Add a class to all elements in an array.
