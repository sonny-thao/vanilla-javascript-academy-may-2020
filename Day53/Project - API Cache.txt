API Cache


Description
-----------

Create a magazine for pirates using an API, and use localStorage to cache the API data for improved performance and network resilience.

The HTML for today’s project is a div with an ID of #app.

For this assignment, you’re going to call The Scuttlebutt API and get back some pirate-themed articles.

You’ll use that data to display a list of headlines and “pirate news blurbs.”

Cache the API data in localStorage for a short time, and use that instead of making a fresh API call on subsequent visits or page reloads.

How long you cache an API varies by how often the data is typically refreshed. For this project, shorter is better because it makes testing easier.
