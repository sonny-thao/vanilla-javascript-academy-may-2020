Character and Word Count


Description
-----------

Modify your character count script to also count the number of words in a block of text. Weâ€™ll again do this in real time as the user types or pastes content in.

The template includes one small adjustment. The paragraph includes second span element, this time with an ID of #word-count.

As the user types or pastes content in, the text of the #word-count and #character-count elements should be updated to show how many words and characters are in the #text field.
