Timer - Formatted


Description
-----------

Format the time in our timer before rendering it into the UI.

Instead of 60 seconds as our duration, letâ€™s use 120, or two minutes.

Before rendering the time into the UI, convert it into M:SS format.

For example, the starting time should be displayed at 2:00. When the remaining time is 5 seconds, it should be displayed as 0:05.
