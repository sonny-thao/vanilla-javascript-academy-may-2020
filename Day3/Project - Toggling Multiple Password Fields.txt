Toggling Multiple Password Fields


Description
-----------

Take your toggle password script and add the ability to toggle the visibility of multiple fields.

When a user clicks on the #show-passwords checkbox, it should show the text for the #current-password and #new-password fields if it’s checked, and mask it if it’s unchecked.
