Debugging Broken Code

We’re going to look at a broken version of the Monsters! game and get it working again.

I took a working version of the game and made a bunch of small breaking changes. Use the console and some detective work to figure out what’s not working, and why, and make the needed changes.

You’re looking for five bugs. One of the bugs doesn’t break the game, so it’s a bit harder to find.

If you want to share your code, I would recommend commenting out the broken line, copy/pasting a fresh version, and fixing that. Prefix the broken line with // @bug {description of what's wrong}.
