Autosave - Other Field Types


Description
-----------

Modify our form saver script to handle field types beyond text inputs.

The form has been modified to include a lot more fields. There’s now a select menu, radio buttons, and checkboxes.

Modify the script to save those fields’ values to localStorage as well, and restore them into the form when the page loads.
