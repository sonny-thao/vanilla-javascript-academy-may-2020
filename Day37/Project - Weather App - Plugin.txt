Weather App - Plugin


Description
-----------

Modify our weather app script to convert it into a plugin.

Modify the script to let developers:

- Pass in their own selector to render the weather into.
- Decide whether to show temperatures in Fahrenheit of Celsius.
- Change what message is shown (ex. It's currently {temperature} and {conditions} in {location}).
- Enable or disable the icon for the weather conditions.
