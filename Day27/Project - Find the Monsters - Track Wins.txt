Find the Monsters - Track Wins


Description
-----------

Modify your "Find the Monsters" game to track whether the user has won or lost, and provide a way for them to play again.

If the user finds the sock before they’ve found all of the monsters, display a message letting them know they lost. If they find all of the monsters, display a message letting them know they’ve won. Either way, show a button that they can click to play again.
