Description
-----------

Write a script that automatically saves form field data as a user types.

The template for this project includes a form with the .save-me class and #save-me ID. It also has input and textarea fields, each with name and id attributes.

I added some basic CSS to make the form a bit easier to read.

As the user types, the value of a form field should automatically be saved. When the page is reloaded or opened back up, the form should be repopulated with the userâ€™s saved data.

If the form is submitted, clear the data from storage and wipe the form.
