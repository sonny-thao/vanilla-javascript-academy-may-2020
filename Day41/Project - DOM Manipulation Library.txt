DOM Manipulation Library


Description
-----------

Build a small DOM manipulation library (a bit like a small, personal jQuery).

The template includes a paragraph with some buttons, and an unordered list.

It also includes some CSS for the button styles.

Create a DOM manipulation library with public methods you can use toâ€¦

    - Get an array of items from the DOM.
    - Get the first and last matching items from the DOM.
    - Add and remove a class to all matching elements.

It should work like jQuery, where you pass in a selector, and can then call helper functions on your matching elements.
