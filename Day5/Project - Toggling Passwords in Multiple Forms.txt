Toggling Passwords in Multiple Forms


Description
-----------

Modify your password toggle script again.

This time, we have two separate forms that show up on the same page—one to change your username, and another to change your password.

Both have password fields in them, and for each form, we again want to include a checkbox that let’s the user toggle password visibility on or off. But, each checkbox should only toggle the fields in its own form.

In the first form, the #show-password checkbox should toggle the #password field visibility. In the second form, the #show-passwords checkbox should toggle the visibility of the #current-password and #new-password fields.

As an extra challenge, see if you can figure out a way to write your script without having to duplicate your code for each form (it’s ok if you can’t).
