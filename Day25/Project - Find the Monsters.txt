Find the Monsters


Description
-----------

Modify your Monster Shuffle project into a game.

Instead of displaying the monsters outright, they’ll all be hidden behind doors. Clicking on one will reveal the monster. If you find the sock before you’ve found all of the monsters, you lose.

(It’s a bit like Minesweeper, if you rememember that game.)

The template includes a new SVG file: door.svg.

Display this image by default, and reveal the monster behind it after it’s clicked. People who navigate the web with a keyboard or use a screen reader should still be able to play this game.
