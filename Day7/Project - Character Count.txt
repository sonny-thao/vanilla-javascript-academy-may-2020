Character Count


Description
-----------

Update the UI to display a live character count as a user types in a textarea field.

The template has a textarea with an ID of #text, and an accompanying label.

The paragraph below it includes a span with an ID of #character-count. Itâ€™s set to 0 by default.

As the user types or pastes text into the #text field, the #character-count content should get updated in real time to display how many characters are in the field.
