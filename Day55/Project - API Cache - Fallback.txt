API Cache - Fallback


Description
-----------

Modify our API cache script to fallback to the cache if the API call fails—even if data has expired. Showing something, even if it’s a bit out of date, is better than showing nothing at all.

In the template file, I’ve added a helper function called getEndpoint() that will randomly return either the real API endpoint or one that doesn’t exist and will fail.

Use this in the fetch() method to make the API call. This deliberately induces a failure 50% of the time for the purposes of this project.

I’ve also shortened to the “good for” time to just 5 seconds to make testing easier.

Here’s what you need to do:

    1. If there’s data in localStorage, and it hasn’t expired, use it.
    2. Otherwise, call the API to get fresh data.
    3. If the API fails and there’s expired data in localStorage, use that instead.
