Sanitizing the NYT API Data


Description
-----------

Modify your script that displays articles from the New York Times API to protect ourselves from cross-site scripting attacks.

While the New York Times is a trust-worth organization, if their API were, for example, hacked, they could unknowingly send back malicious code.

Before rendering API data into the DOM as markup, sanitize it to protect yourself from any malicious code that might get sent back.
