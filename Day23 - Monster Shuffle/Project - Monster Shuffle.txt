Monster Shuffle


Description
-----------

Take an array of monsters, mix them up, and display them in the DOM. It’s inspired by the movie Monsters, Inc.

The template for this project includes an array of monsters (and one sock).

Each monster (or sock) has a matching SVG in the source code. For example, there’s a monster3 in the array, and a monster3.svg in the source code.

Shuffle the array of monsters, and render the matching SVG files into the #app element.

Some simple CSS has been included so that you can focus on the JavaScript. It provides a simple three-column grid system, and makes img elements responsive.
